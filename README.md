# Outlier Ensembles
outlier_ensembles/ contains the elements of my thesis project. Specifically,
it contains:

- master.py is the master program which runs the ensemble members.
- implementations/ consists of the Zero++ and FPOFSampler implementation
and utils.py which contains some helper methods.
- data/ contains five UCI ML repo data sets, all categorical in their original
form, one hot encoded and as unique strings
- preprocessors/ contains five preprocessing scripts all ending in _prepper.csv.
and the string_converter.py script, which makes binary data sets into a
data set of unique strings.
- visualization_code contains an unstructured script for making the visualizations
for this thesis.
